# New York City Collision Analysis

In this analysis, I examined New York City's open-source dataset on motor vehicle collisions. The aim of the analysis was to identify the street with the highest number of collisions, determine the most common causes of accidents, and identify the types of vehicles typically involved.

## Data Cleaning Summary:

In the data cleaning process, I encountered numerous missing values primarily due to reports involving two or fewer vehicles. This resulted in incomplete information in the 'CONTRIBUTING FACTOR VEHICLE' and 'VEHICLE TYPE CODE' columns. To address this, I populated missing entries with 'Not Applicable.' 

I also removed any columns labeled 'Unspecified' in the 'CONTRIBUTING FACTOR VEHICLE' category, as they were irrelevant to our goal of analyzing accident causes. 

Furthermore, I addressed inconsistencies in the 'VEHICLE TYPE CODE' column, which contained many mismatched strings and incomplete entries. I focused on vehicle types with counts exceeding 500 and manually mapped and grouped them. For instance, I consolidated 'station wagon/sport utility vehicle' and 'sport utility/station wagon' into a single category labeled 'SUV.' As for the remaining counts below 500, I grouped their sums into a variable that I named 'Unknown.'

These steps not only improved the dataset's quality but also made it more suitable for analysis.

## Summary of Analysis:

The majority of collisions that have been reported in New York City, which resulted in someone getting injured or killed or damages worth USD 1000, have occurred on Broadway, 3rd Avenue, and Atlantic Avenue. Looking at the top 3 causes of collisions, we can see that the top reason for accidents is distracted driving, failure to yield the right of way, and backing unsafely. The majority of vehicles involved in the accidents were sedans, SUVs, and taxis.
